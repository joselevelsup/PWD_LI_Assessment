# SQL Challenge

Prerequistes:

- Install Node and NPM (Node Version 16 or higher)
- Install the packages here using `npm install`
- Run the Migrations `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`
- Once migrations are done, you don't even need to run the app against Postman. You can if you want to though. There are tests available in the `__tests__` folder. Just run `npm run test` from the `problem7` folder. The testing framework being used is [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
- If you don't want to install `postgres`, you can use the docker-compose file. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose is installed. 
- To start the DB, use `docker-compose up -d`. To turn it off, use `docker-compose down`
