Prerequistes:

- Install Node and NPM (Node Version 16 or higher)
- Install the packages here using `npm install`
- Run the Migrations `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`
- Once migrations are done, you don't even need to run the app against Postman. You can if you want to though. There are tests available in the `__tests__` folder. Just run `npm run test` from the `problem7` folder. The testing framework being used is ( Jest )[https://jestjs.io/].
